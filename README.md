# This project is a simple presentation of the useContext() hook.

# Project objectives:

- Create a global context to share dtata (a state) accross the application instead pf passing it via props.
- Avoid prop drilling by the use of the context provider property to wrap the root elementand make the data available at all layer of the application.
- Provide a means of granting or denying permissions/data through the explicit use of the context comsumer property, by wrappingthe elements to check with the consumer() function.

# Studied and implemented from React-and-React-Native-4th-Edition.
